## ‚ú® Key Features

The website includes the following standout features:

### üß© Jigsaw Puzzle Game

*   **Intuitive Gameplay:** Click to rotate puzzle pieces 90 degrees and drag-and-drop them into the correct position on the 3x3 game board.
*   **Diverse Image Sets:** Choose from multiple image sets with various themes.
*   **Two Game Modes:**
    *   **Classic Mode:** Play without a time limit; a timer will record your completion time.
    *   **Countdown Mode:** Challenge yourself to complete the puzzle within a set time limit (20-60 seconds).
*   **Reference Image:** A complete original image is always available for reference during gameplay.
*   **Result Notifications:** Displays a congratulatory message upon winning or a notification when time runs out.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Image Processing Tools

1.  **Crop Image to Square (1:1):**
    *   Perfect for creating avatars, social media thumbnails, or any image requiring a square aspect ratio.
    *   Upload any image, preview it, and intuitively adjust a square selection area.
    *   Easily drag-and-drop to move and resize the selection area, ensuring the 1:1 ratio is always maintained.
    *   Preview the result and download the cropped square image.

2.  **Split Image into Grid (e.g., 3x3):**
    *   Divide a large image into multiple smaller, equal pieces in a customizable grid format (rows x columns).
    *   Ideal for creating jigsaw puzzle pieces, unique grid photo effects for Instagram or Pinterest, or breaking down large images for easier sharing.
    *   Upload an image, enter the desired number of rows and columns, and the tool will automatically cut and allow you to download each piece.

3.  **Resize Image Dimensions:**
    *   Easily adjust the width and height of your images in pixels.
    *   **"Lock Aspect Ratio" Option:**
        *   If checked, entering one dimension will automatically calculate the other to maintain the original aspect ratio, preventing distortion.
        *   If unchecked, you can freely enter both width and height.
    *   Preview and download the resized image, very useful for specific dimension requirements.
